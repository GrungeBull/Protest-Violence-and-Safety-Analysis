# Protest-Violence-and-Safety-Analysis

## Introduction
In this repository, we explore the dynamics of protest violence and safety. The analysis covers protest actions in 162 countries from 1990 to 2014. This project aims to provide insights and recommendations for protest organizers to effectively plan and manage demonstrations, ensuring the safety of participants.

## Key Findings
- **Shift in protest activity:** After 2009, there was a significant increase in protest occurrences.
- **Role of responses and demands:** Negotiations and accommodation by governments led to lower fatality rates during protests. Certain protest demands were associated with higher levels of violence.
- **Protest size and safety:** Larger protests were found to be safer, while medium-sized protests had a higher likelihood of violence.
- **Regional variations:** Significant differences in protest activity and violence were observed across regions.

By understanding these factors, protest organizers can make informed decisions and adopt appropriate strategies.
